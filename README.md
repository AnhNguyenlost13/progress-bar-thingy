*If you want to report a bug or leave a suggestion, [open a new issue](https://github.com/AnhNguyenlost13/progress-bar-thingy/issues/new/choose) or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uFj8SSUhRa). Contributions are also welcome.*

## Why?
Originally inspired by [Naxrin's ProgressBarColor mod](https://github.com/Naxrin/Progress-Bar-Color). I originally intended this to be an even simpler mod to make the texture white, but decided to expand it.

## Building
For more info, read  [the Geode docs](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/getting-started/create-mod#build).
You probably should've known how to do this already if you're here right...?
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnhNguyenlost13/progress-bar-thingy.git
cd progress-bar-thingy

# Assuming you have the Geode CLI set up already
geode build
```
