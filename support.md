I would be really glad if you can buy me a pair of thigh highs or arm sleeves, but unfortunately I probably can't accept anything from strangers.

A kind "meow" to me is also sufficient to make my day! I would really appreciate it if you can contribute to the code. If you have ideas, you can either open an issue on the GitHub repository or join the Discord server.
